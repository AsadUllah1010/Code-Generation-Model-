# Code-Generation-Model-
A code generation model is a type of artificial intelligence that can automatically generate source code based on a given input, which can be natural language instructions, existing code snippets, or structured data
# Introduction
To build a code generation model using Large Language Models (LLMs), we can start by collecting a large, diverse dataset of code examples and related documentation from various programming languages. Then, preprocess this data to ensure quality and consistency. In the end, fine-tune a pre-trained LLM, such as GPT-4 or any appropriate LLM, on the dataset to specialize it in understanding and generating code. So, to build a code generation model using LLMs, we need a lot of data on code snippets. We can collect code snippets from GitHub by using the GitHub API. So, before proceeding with the task of building a code generation model, I recommend you sign up for the GitHub API and get your access token. Here’s the process you can follow:
1. Go to GitHub Settings.
2. Click on “Generate new token”.
3. Select the necessary scopes (at least repo scope to access repositories).
4. Generate the token and copy it.

Now, let’s get started with the task of building a Code Generation model using LLMs. Before proceeding, here are the commands to install some of the libraries you will be using for the first time if it’s your first time using LLMs:
1. pip install transformers datasets
2. pip install transformers[torch] accelerate -U
And, as we are using GitHub in this task to collect code snippets, run this command as well in your command prompt before getting started:

1. pip install PyGithub datasets

# Conclusion
We are initializing a GitHub client with a personal access token, specifying the “openai/gym” repository, and defining a function to extract Python function definitions from the code. We are then iterating over the contents of the repository to collect Python files, extracting function definitions from each file, and storing them in a dataset. In the end, we are creating a Hugging Face dataset from the extracted data and saving it to disk, which will allow us to use this dataset for tasks such as training or fine-tuning a code generation model. We are initializing the tokenizer and model for code generation using a pre-trained model from Salesforce, and setting the pad token to ensure proper input formatting. We are then loading our previously saved dataset of code snippets from disk, splitting it into training and test sets to create a validation framework, and defining a preprocessing function to tokenize the code examples to ensure they are appropriately truncated and padded to a consistent length for model training.
<br>
 we are defining a function generate_code that takes a code prompt and uses the fine-tuned model to generate a continuation of the code. By tokenizing the input prompt and passing it to the model, we are generating a sequence of tokens up to a specified maximum length. These tokens are then decoded back into a readable string of code.  code generation model is a type of artificial intelligence that can automatically generate source code based on a given input, which can be natural language instructions, existing code snippets, or structured data.
